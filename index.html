        <p>This summer I started a new job at the <a href=https://locations.sonicdrivein.com/mo/maryville/721-south-main-street.html>
Sonic</a> here in Maryville. I started as a Carhop but was moved to Kitchen with the possibility of becoming a Crew Leader. Basically a supervisor.</p>
        <p>Other things I did this summer were organize my magic cards, play video games, and celebrate my 2 year anniversary with my wife.</p>
